# ðŸ›’ Retail Profit Analysis

This project is a simple breakdown of how retail businesses can use their sales data to understand which products, regions, or categories are doing well and which ones need improvement.
I worked with Excel to analyze key trends in profit, sales, and product performance.

## ðŸ“¦ About the Dataset

The Excel file `retail_profit_data.xlsx` contains detailed records of retail sales, including:

- Product categories
- Order quantities
- Sales figures
- Profit margins
- Regional performance

The goal was to figure out which areas of the business were generating the most value â€” and where resources might be better allocated.

## ðŸ“Š What This Project Covers

- How different product categories perform in terms of profit
- Which regions are generating the most sales
- The relationship between order volume and profitability
- Identifying patterns that could help improve business decisions

This was all done in Excel, using pivot tables, formulas, and basic charts.
